# Building Temperature Prediction Project

This repository contains code and analysis for clustering and analyzing temperature data from building rooms to understand thermal patterns and energy efficiency.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes temperature sensor data from different rooms in a building to identify patterns, group similar rooms together, and provide insights for optimizing energy usage and thermal comfort.

## Repository Structure

### Main Files

- `clustering.py`: Contains functions for loading, preprocessing and clustering room temperature data. Implements K-means clustering to group rooms based on their thermal characteristics and physical properties like volume.

- `clean_data.py`: Handles data preprocessing and cleaning of raw sensor data. Removes outliers, handles missing values, and prepares data for analysis.

- `visualisation.py`: Creates visualizations of temperature patterns, clustering results, and other relevant insights using matplotlib and seaborn.

- `data_analysis.py`: Performs statistical analysis on the temperature data and clustering results to extract meaningful insights.

- `predicting.py`: Implements machine learning models to predict room temperatures
